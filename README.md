Google Analytics Service Account Sample
=========
Console application written in C# to demonstrate accessing Google Analytics Data via a Service Account and OAuth 2.0. 
From what documentation and examples I found online, it appears methods and libraries for accessing Google Apis change constantly,
but this application was working as of January 2014.
